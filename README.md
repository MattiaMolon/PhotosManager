# PhotosManager
This java application tries to understand through metadatas when a picture or video present in a folder was originally taken.<br />
After done so, it reorders them per year in different foulders.

## How to it
To consult the code:
* download the project
* open it in a netbeans environment or converte it in your favourite one

To try it:
* download the dist folder
* double-click on the FotoManager file (make sure your Java SDK is updated at least at the version 9.0)
* when the app starts, choose the folder in which the pics and videos are
* let it works until it finished :)
